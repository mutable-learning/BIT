This is a longer project that uses a variety of tkinter widgets including: notebook, combobox, buttons and text boxes to create a simple interface for working with asymmetric encryption.

It uses the [Cryptography Library](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography) to create and work with RSA public and private keys.

Build this application and test it out with your friends and family by sending and receiving encrypted messages.
